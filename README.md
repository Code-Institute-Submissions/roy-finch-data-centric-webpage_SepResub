<h1>Data Centric Website Development</h1>
Within this project I was instructed to create a website that I would like to create from an idea that I have had. I was instructed to create a website that puts use to the python and flask server language and allows for me to create a forwarding frame which would create and structure out a website which can be used within a server instance. I have used this to create something that I had widely wanted to create from the start. I was instructed to use some other langauges as well such as HTML CSS and Javascript. I have chosen to only use the CSS and HTML languages though as the functionality of my webpage and the practicality of the website was created with just the use of what I have chosen to do.

I have selected to create a project with rules set upon myself as well. I want to create a website that holds a series of different pieces of information that are published by a community just like a forum page. I want to be able to allow for a user to create a page about a game and add a series of different types of information to the pages to inform others of what they have done, or just how to play a game. I have selected to not allow the use oif images and videos. Although they can help a user be able to understand the actual information better. I wanted to stick to just text as this is intended to be a writen form. I am aware that the inclusion of images and videos would help users and views understand the information better but yet would begin to become more complicated and really change my idea and opinion to far past what I want to do.

I wanted to also include a form of accounts and make it so that a user only needs a username and password. I am aware of the security issues that will arise but I have made it so that on the website content which is given a blue tag has been given a seal to say that this information is better than others that you may find. I understand that I have also not included the ability for a user to delete or edit a comment but will not allow the user to have such a strong control of the site. The reason behind not allowing a user to edit a comment is so that they may not change the content of a comment that has been given a blue seal. This will allow for users and views to wrongly abuse power and also would effect the use of my site further. I want to create a site where its content is not compeltely monitored but yet you can see a series of comments within different areas that you may view comments which are controller or authorized.

<h2>Introduction</h2>
Within this project which I widely plan out through a series of different ways I will begin by  creating an idea that uses the rules and ideas that are given to me by both the course and myself.

I am already thinking of an idea of which I would like to create the next situation is to begin to find out how to produce and create this idea in a practical project. I would like for a site that can both create and post forms and also allow for people to view the site both as a users or as a viewer. I would like to keep in mind that people in my life are unable to deal with passwords, usernames and emails so I have chosen to make the site simple but effective. I want to make sure that all are welcome and all can use this site no matter what maybe the situation. I also want to make the site setup so that a user can create a post but at the same time can not edit it or effect it, as I want to publish the content and decide for myself if a comment is suppose to stay or leave the site. Within practicality there would be a few features which I would also add but due to the small level of use to this site these changes are possibly unneccessary.

I would like to begin with a simple style and a simple set of fonts and colours to be decided as this is how I begin to build a website. I need to understand what the site should look like and what I want to create when making the site.

As I understood I wanted to create a site I also wanted to make it a forum or view page which can be used by different people to post a comment. With this in mind I would also like to create a suitable but catchy name which can wear the theme with pride. I believe this mesh and moulding of these two features are what create the website for what it really is.

<h2>Initial Concept</h2>
I want to create a site about games, which will have the user be able to write about a game of there choice. I also want to make sure that the user or viewer can also read a comment no matter what. I want to make sure that a user can possibly create a page if the game is not included.

Within producing and creating comments I want the user to be able to tell the site what type of comment they are producing. Initialy, I had no intension of adding a general tag but shortly after creating the site and creating some different things I had added that to help users to just produce what they would like and if it didn't fall into the tags that where there they could also just still have there comment or voice heard on my site. I thought that this would give the user an ability to state how they feel about a game and properly show to others what they feel.

The other tags where an initial idea which I had from the beginning. I had began this idea with just 3 tags, guide, trivia and glitches, as this site would be able showing the user or view how to complete a game or giving the user information about the game, lore or anything they can do which may exploite the game. I want a site that any user can user and try to make the site simple to use. These three tags originally summed up the site and the pages really well but as the idea began I had realised this wasn't just enough. Although I want this site to be a list of pieces of information I still wanted to show other peoples opinions of the site.

Also within the production of the site it was hard at first to use Flask as this was rather new to me. I was able to understand this language rather well due to past experiences with the language that this extension uses. I had picked this language up rather well. I had taught myself how to use the site as I like to be able to use the language without much information from another as I believe to undestand how to use something is rather difficult if instructed, and is easier to learn to overcome problems and issues themselves.

I had also wanted to create this site without the use of any assets that are not my own. I like to create everything myself even if this may sometimes be difficult. If you create everything yourself you realise that your sear undestanding of your idea is what helps when you are producing the website and assets. You know what you need to do and you doing it helps you refine and enforce your idea about the site. The assets are an equal part of your site and its identity and creating these yourself helps the most when producing everything.

Within creating the name I had settled for a name which used a starting word which was common within both words. I had settled for Retro Reviews as my initial intension was to create a site where people could talk about old, retro games. This would help me create an effective mirror like effect on the logo. This would allow for me to produce a logo with a simple but yet effective use of two disting colours which have a complex relationship and also would allow for me to simply produce a RR logo. I wanted the logo to also present the user with two colours which can also imply a form of danger, or a form of incorrect. The other colour was a blue colour with a similar contrast and was used to be a way to show a positive or correct implication. This difference between colour is what I want to stick with thoughout the webpage and I want to use these two colours for both the similarity and constract and what they imply.

I wanted to also create a search function which will use the colour blue just as though it is a hyperlink to present the user with an understanding that it is just a standard search engine similar to google or other search engine. As I want this site to be simple and easily understood by others I tried to use the colours similar to other wesbites. This conventional use would be to just try and show the users a simple but effective site which offers them a similarities to other locations they may have seen this coloured theme. These colours need to be included thoughout to hold up the theme in all of the webpages I have created.
